Why?\n\n           Answer: Because if input is:\n             \"tensor([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 10, 12, 13, 14,  0, 15,\n                      16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24,  2])\", that's length 29. If\n                      embedding dimension arg for model (which is the output of the embedding\n                      layer and input to the linear layer) is say, 5, then the embedding\n                      layer will output a 2d matrix of size 29,5 because there's 29 values in\n                      the original tensor so theres a nested tensor for each one. Remember the\n                      embedding dimension is INPUT to the linear layer, it has the same value\n                      of 5. Since the embedding layer output shape is 29,5 , it works.\n\n\n          Solution 2: I used t.mean(x,dim=0) which get the mean in a horizontal fashion. Why did\n            it work? BEFORE matrix x goes into the embedding layer, the tensor is:\n            \"tensor([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 10, 12, 13, 14,  0, 15,\n                     16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24,  2])\" More importantly the shape/size\n            is 29. AFTER the matrix x goes through the embedding layer, it's shape/size is (29,5).\n            It's now 2d. Why? Well because the output of the embedding layer (called embed_dim)\n            is 5. So it gets 29 matrices of length 5 each. Then the linear layers INPUT is embed_dim\n            as well which is of course 5. So the linear layer can take a 2d matrix as long as the\n            columns of the 2d matrix (the \"5\" in 29,5) matches the linear layers INPUT (input is\n            also 5).\n            Ex Code:\n            \"td = t.tensor([[1,4,2,8],\n                            [6,9,3,7]], dtype=t.float32)\n              x = t.nn.Linear(4, 1)\n              x(td)\"\n\n            Will print something like:\n            \"tensor([[2.5558],\n                     [4.6453]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward0>)\"\n\n            Ex code 2 (1d):\n            \" # 1d linear layer test. Tensor is \"tensor([5., 5., 5.])\", shape is torch.Size([3])\n              e = t.tensor([5] * 3, dtype=t.float32)\n              x = t.nn.Linear(3, 1)\n              # Will print something like \"tensor([0.6625], grad_fn=<ViewBackward0>)\" is linear output is 1.\n              print(x(e))\"\n\n\n\n          Conclusion: Solving the issue WITHOUT messing with t.mean(x, dim=1) is impossible. Simply\n            because of the dimensions of both x (after it goes through t.mean) and the input of the\n            linear layer.\n            1) Dimension of x after t.mean(x, dim=1) - torch.Size([29])\n            2) Dimensions of linear layer - 5,3. 5 input, 3 output.\n\n            I initially THOUGHT the REAL size was 30, due to programming indexing from 0. If that\n            was the case I had an idea to resize the x matrix into shape (6,5) because that'll be\n            accepted by the linear linear and it'd work. As a matter of fact I wrote some test\n            code for just that issue, resizing a tensor that was initially 30 in length but the\n            wrong input size for a linear layer that had input as 5. See code below:\n            \"\n              # Get same values.\n              t.manual_seed(0)\n\n              # nt = new tensor. Make tensor of size 30, (0-29)\n              nt = t.rand(30)\n              print(f'New tensor:\\n{nt}\\nNew tensor SIZE: {nt.shape}\\n\\n')\n\n              # Create a linear layer which only takes 1d tensors of 5, and 2d tensors of (n, 5).\n              ll = t.nn.Linear(5, 1)\n\n              # Try reshaping the new tensor to be in form (n, 5). First get size and check if its divisible by embed_dim (ed) 5\n              ed = 5\n              cur_mat_size = nt.size()[0]\n\n              # Can 30 be divided by 5?
