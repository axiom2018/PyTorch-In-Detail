# Description

I really love using PyTorch & NLP. I'm constantly explore the basics and more advanced concepts in both. The primary reason I'm putting this on Github is to help others 
understand both NLP concepts and PyTorch basics. <b><i>The code is extremely well commented and potentially can help others learn as well.</i></b> Due to certain links, 
sites, and even documentation with poor explanations, I figured I might as well share my understanding. Also, since I love NLP, the "NLP_In_Detail" file all about just 
that. Playing around with different NLP functionality. However the "Basics_In_Detail" file is strictly non NLP PyTorch code. 


### <b><i>Side note to keep in mind: </i></b>
Admittedly the comment formatting is a tiny bit off. Why? Well I was working on both portions of code at my regular job. So I was using Google Colab on my phone and in 
order to properly <i>SEE</i> the comments, I had to not make them so long in a horizontal sense.
